## ðŸ§ª How to Test

Follow these steps to test the complete chat, AI, and UI generation flow:

1.  **Install Ollama**:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

2.  **Start the Backend**:

Set up Python in project root directory.

```bash
pants export
# change `3.11.13` in the path to your python version, or to `latest` for venv symlink created from `CONTRIBUTING.md`!
source dist/export/python/virtualenvs/python-default/3.11.13/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=./libs:./tests:$PYTHONPATH
```

Start Assisten API

```bash
python tests/ngui-e2e/main.py
python main.py # if running in VS Code
```
You can check it's running under [http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs)

3.  **Start the Frontend**:

Navigate to the `NGUI-e2e` folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm link dynamicui
npm run dev
```

Note: It's expected you already build `dynamicui` package located in [libs_js/next_gen_ui_react](/libs_js/next_gen_ui_react/)
